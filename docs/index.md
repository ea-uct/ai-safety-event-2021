## Discussion Agenda
Firstly, we would like to discuss AI alignment more broadly. Why is AI alignment something we should be concerned about? How can we try to ensure that AGI is aligned with human values? How do we mitigate the existential risk posed by AGI? Professor Tommie Meyer suggested Stuart J. Russell's recent book "Human Compatible" as a framework to structure the discussion. We would like to see where panellists agree and disagree on his takes.

 
Then we would like to take the second part of the discussion into a more focused direction: suppose we successfully manage the alignment problem and AGI does not pose any immediate existential risk to humanity, AI will none the less be a highly disruptive force to the world and global economy. Many say AI will be the next great industrial revolution. If that is the case, how can we ensure that this technology does not only benefit the developed world but has positive effects in Africa as well? Or will powerful AI in the hands of the developed world simply lead to greater exploitation of Africa and the developing world?
